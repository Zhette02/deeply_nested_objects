core beleifs creating thougts


I want this project to portray how my mind feels to live in. Specificly highlighting how chaotic it feels
to exist with so many things going on. 


I am wondering how I will portray thoughts that come from the senses of the outside world vs thoughts that
come from inside. 

Maybe each thought comes from both inside and outside and each has parameters

final outcomes for this project:

dwarf fortress grid displaying thought populating a mind and interacting with outside stimuli 

scrolling text that looks like the terminal that moves down everytime a new thought generates.

maybe a collage website that uses my drawings


draft of elements:

- core beleifs
    - core beleifs determine if a thought is reacting negative or positivly, if a thought happens or not, 
    what catagory that thought fits into

- something to generate text or verbal content
- something that generates thoughts (function?)
- a template for the thoughts (that has  input from outside stimuli and core beleifs)
- some way to display this data
